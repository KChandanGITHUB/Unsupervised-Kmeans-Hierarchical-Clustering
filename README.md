# Unsupervised-Kmeans-Hierarchical-Clustering

### Engineering Colleges Case Study
- Education is fast becoming a very competitive sector with hundreds of institutions to choose from. It is a life transforming experience for any student and it has to be a thoughtful decision. There are ranking agencies which do a survey of all the colleges to provide more insights to students and to identify different types of engineering colleges in the country to better understand the state of affairs.
### My aim is to.
- How many different types (clusters/segments) of colleges can be found from the data?
- How are these different types of colleges different from each other? Provide a profile summary of the clusters/segments, provide insights and make business recommendations.
